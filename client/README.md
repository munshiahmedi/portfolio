# Frontend Developer Portfolio

A clean and professional portfolio starter built with **React 18**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. It is intentionally minimal—ideal for a junior frontend developer to extend with styling and additional features.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

2. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   The app will be served at the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

3. **Build for production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

4. **Preview the production build**

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Customisation Ideas

- Replace placeholder text with your own bio, skills, and project details.
- Add styling using plain CSS, Tailwind, or any library of your choice.
- Integrate routing (e.g., React Router) or smooth scrolling as you grow the project.
